# Collaborative Rating system for wish-listed items

Suppose I am the customer, and I have wish-listed some of my favourite items. But now, I am confused about which ones to buy :(  <br/>
This feauture of Collaborative Personalized Rating comes to my rescue :) <br/>
It enables me to get my friends' opinion about the products. They can rate the items on a scale of 0 to 5 based on their choices. <br/>
I can then see the average rating and thus take a quicker and contented decision. This shall make my purchase experience better and more satysfying. <br/>

We implemented this on the **WAMP server** in our localhost. <br/>
**Technologies used:** <br/>
Backend- PHP <br/>
Front end- HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br/>
Database- MySQL

# To use:
Download the folder from github and save in www folder of the wamp64 folder. <br/>
1.Type localhost/CollaborativePersononalizedRating/index.php in search bar <br/>
OR <br/>
2.Add the folder location to virtual host and type the given site name in the search bar. <br/>
