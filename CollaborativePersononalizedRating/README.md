# Personal/Friends review system for wish-listed items

Suppose I am the customer, and I have wish-listed some of my favourite items. But now, I am confused about which ones to buy :( 
This feauture of Collaborative Personalized Rating comes to my rescue :)
It enables me to get my friends' opinion about the products. They can rate the dresses on a scale of 0 to 5 based on their choices.
I can then see the average rating and thus take a quicker and contented decision. This shall make my purchase experience better and more satysfying.

We implemented this on the WAMP server in our localhost. 
Technologies used:
Backend-PHP
Front end- HTML,CSS,JavaScript

# To use:
Download the folder from github and save in www folder of the wamp64 folder. 
1.Type localhost/CollaborativePersononalizedRating/index.php in search bar
OR
2.Add the folder loaction to virual host and type the given site name in the search bar.

For the purpose of demo, the list of friends and products are already added to the database. The feature of adding friends is to be implemented before the next phase of the hackathon.
